                <p>I created PacePeek because I liked to build projects and wanted to know what other people were working on. There was really no way of knowing that unless going through their code changes manually and reading their commit messages. And we all know how commit messages are on side projects XD. Sure some people share their progress on X by building in public but it requires effort. With the rise of better and cheaper llms, this kind of tracking is now possible. The turning point for this was Meta's llama3 which is reliable/cheap enough to do this job.</p>
