PacePeek will is social media for coders, where people can come to see updates on other peoples projects. posts are greated automatically by analyzing your incoming github commits.

Ideas:
- find other users by their location and similar coding projects? a map of users and you can see who have signed up and are creating stuff near you.
- for finding new users there could be like a list of top interesting posts per day which could be on their own "find"-page or sprinkled in between other posts if user wants
- remove user posts after some amount of time like two months and make the posts from that month into a summary post which explains what the user did that month. user could also add a comment on that month posts.
  - This would make users who are following the actual posts feel more unique and exclusive since they are seeing the actual progress being made and still keep the future followers up to date on the progress the user has made so they could judge if they want to follow that particular user.
- add a premium feature where user has ability to keep all their posts from the month they are subscribed on.
- there could also be some achievements that user could accomplish on some month like the number of features they implemented OR now that i think about it save some statistics on the number of lines they wrote or something
- add google charts for some analytics

maybe:
- add ability for other than the owner of the repo to make contributions. like collaborators could make commits, but only if the repo exists already since only owner and admin level collaborators can add webhooks to the repository on github.

- if there is a huge commit that could be split into many posts, it might be just good to first check if commit's tokens are over some limit and then if they are do the following:
